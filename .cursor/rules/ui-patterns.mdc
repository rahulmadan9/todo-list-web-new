# UI Patterns & Interaction Guide

- The main to-do list UI and logic are in [src/app/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/page.tsx).
- Task creation and editing use a unified form layout with a checkbox, title textarea, description textarea, and a custom calendar dropdown for due dates.
- The calendar dropdown is implemented in the same file and uses a glassmorphism effect for its background.
- Toast notifications are handled by [src/app/components/Toast.tsx](mdc:src/app/components/Toast.tsx).
- All UI is styled using Tailwind CSS tokens and follows the design system described in the project documentation.
