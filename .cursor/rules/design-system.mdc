# Design System Reference

- The app uses a dark-first design system, with color tokens and component conventions defined in [Design_System.md](mdc:../../Design_System.md).
- Key color tokens: bg/900, bg/800, border/600, text/100, brand/500, state/success, state/error, etc.
- Typography uses the Inter font family, with clear hierarchy for headings, body, and captions.
- Components use consistent radii, spacing, and shadow levels as described in the design system.
- Buttons, inputs, and calendar dropdowns follow the interaction and accessibility guidelines in the design system.
