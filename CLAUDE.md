# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Commands

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack (faster builds)
- `npm run build` - Build production bundle
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality checks

### Testing
No dedicated test scripts are configured. Tests are run via:
- Hook files: `src/app/hooks/useSync.test.ts`
- Library tests: `src/app/lib/sync.test.ts`, `src/app/lib/network.test.ts`

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Backend/Database**: Firebase (Firestore + Auth)
- **State Management**: Custom React hooks with local storage fallback
- **Icons**: Lucide React

### Core Architecture Patterns

**Dual Storage Strategy**: The app operates with a dual-storage architecture supporting both authenticated and guest users:
- **Guest users**: Tasks stored in localStorage only
- **Authenticated users**: Tasks stored in Firestore with offline queue for synchronization

**Offline-First Design**: Built around network resilience:
- Tasks work fully offline via localStorage
- Network detection with automatic queue processing
- Optimistic updates with rollback on failures
- Conflict resolution for synchronization

**Task Synchronization**: Sophisticated sync system in `src/app/lib/sync.ts`:
- Duplicate detection with confidence scoring
- Automatic conflict resolution for high-confidence matches
- Smart merging strategies for task properties
- Progress tracking and error handling

### Key Directories

**`src/app/`** - Main application directory
- `page.tsx` - Main todo list interface (~1200 lines, contains calendar, task management, auth integration)
- `firebase.ts` - Firebase configuration and initialization
- `layout.tsx` - Root layout with font setup

**`src/app/components/`** - Reusable UI components
- `AuthForm.tsx` - Authentication forms (sign in/up)
- `Toast.tsx` - Notification system
- `LoadingSpinner.tsx` - Loading states
- `*StatusIndicator.tsx` - Network and sync status components
- `ConflictResolver.tsx` - Handle sync conflicts

**`src/app/hooks/`** - Custom React hooks
- `useLocalStorage.ts` - Local storage operations for tasks
- `useOfflineQueue.ts` - Queue management for offline actions
- `useSync.ts` - Task synchronization between local and cloud

**`src/app/lib/`** - Core business logic
- `firestore.ts` - Firebase operations with retry logic and validation
- `sync.ts` - Advanced synchronization algorithms and conflict resolution
- `localStorage.ts` - Local storage utilities
- `network.ts` - Network detection and connection quality assessment
- `offlineQueue.ts` - Queue processing for offline operations

### Design System Implementation

The app follows a comprehensive dark-theme design system defined in `Design_System.md`:

**Colors**: Uses OKLCH color space with CSS custom properties:
- Background: `bg-900` (#0E1015), `bg-800` (#141720), `bg-700` (#1B1F29)
- Text: `text-100` (#E5E7EB), `text-200` (#9CA3AF), `text-300` (#6B7280)
- Brand: `brand-500` (#2DD4BF), `brand-600` (#14B8A6), `brand-700` (#0D9488)

**Typography**: Inter font family with specific sizing and spacing scales

**Components**: Follow atomic design principles with consistent interaction patterns

### State Management Patterns

**Local Storage Hook**: `useLocalStorage` provides CRUD operations with error handling
**Offline Queue Hook**: `useOfflineQueue` manages pending actions when offline
**Sync Hook**: `useSync` orchestrates synchronization with progress tracking and conflict resolution

Tasks flow through these layers:
1. UI action â†’ Optimistic local update
2. Online: Direct Firestore operation
3. Offline: Queue action for later processing
4. Sync: Resolve conflicts and merge changes

### Network Architecture

**Connection Management**: 
- Real-time network state tracking
- Connection quality assessment (can sync vs basic connectivity)
- Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

**Firebase Integration**:
- Authentication via email/password
- Firestore subcollections: `/users/{userId}/tasks`
- Security rules enforce user-level isolation
- Retry logic with validation for all operations

### Key Features

**Task Management**: Full CRUD with rich editing (multi-line support, due dates, notes)
**Drag & Drop**: Reordering with visual feedback (implementation in progress)
**Calendar Integration**: Custom calendar component with date selection
**Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with accessible interactions
**Authentication**: Optional sign-in with local storage fallback

## Development Guidelines

### File Organization
- Main logic stays in `src/app/page.tsx` - avoid splitting unless absolutely necessary
- New components go in `src/app/components/`
- Business logic belongs in `src/app/lib/`
- Custom hooks in `src/app/hooks/`

### Code Style
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns
- Use Tailwind classes consistently with design system tokens
- Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Maintain accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for core utilities (`*.test.ts` files)
- Integration testing for sync operations
- Manual accessibility testing required

### Firebase Development
- Use environment variables for configuration (with fallbacks for development)
- All Firestore operations include retry logic and validation
- Security rules located in `firestore.rules`

## Important Patterns

**Optimistic Updates**: All user actions show immediate feedback, then sync/rollback
**Error Recovery**: Failed operations show toast messages with retry options
**Progressive Enhancement**: App works without authentication, enhances with cloud sync
**Accessibility**: Comprehensive ARIA labeling, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
