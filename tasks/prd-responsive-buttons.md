# PRD: Responsive Button Feedback

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for updating all buttons across the web application to provide visual feedback for `hover` and `active` (click) states. The goal is to ensure every button is responsive and all interactions are consistent with the established `Design_System.md`. This will improve the user experience by providing clear, immediate feedback for user actions and creating a more polished and professional user interface.

## 2. Goals

*   Identify all `<button>` elements and custom button components throughout the codebase.
*   Apply appropriate `hover` and `active` styles to all buttons that currently lack them.
*   Audit and update existing button styles to ensure they are fully compliant with the `Design_System.md` guidelines.
*   Implement all styles using the project's existing Tailwind CSS setup.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As a user,** when I move my cursor over a button, I want to see a visual change so that I can immediately recognize it as an interactive element.
*   **As a user,** when I click down on a button, I want to see a distinct visual change so that I have clear feedback that my click has been registered by the system.

## 4. Functional Requirements

*   All buttons in the application **must** have a `hover` state.
*   All buttons in the application **must** have an `active` state (while being clicked).
*   The specific styles for these states must conform to the **`6.1 Buttons`** section of `Design_System.md`:
    *   **Primary:** Base: `brand/500`. `hover:bg-brand-600`, `active:bg-brand-700`.
    *   **Secondary:** Base: transparent with `1px border/600`. `hover:bg-bg-700`.
    *   **Ghost:** Base: transparent. `hover:bg-bg-800`.
    *   **Destructive:** Base: `state/error`. The hover state should darken the base color by approximately 8%.
*   All interactive state changes on buttons should be animated according to the **`7. Motion & Interaction`** section of the design system, specifically using the `anim/fast` token (120ms duration, `cubic-bezier(.4,0,.2,1)` curve).
*   The implementation must use Tailwind CSS utility classes (e.g., `hover:bg-brand-600`, `active:bg-brand-700`).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   This task will not alter the existing functionality or placement of any button.
*   No new button variants will be created. The focus is solely on implementing the existing defined states.
*   This task will not cover elements that are styled to look like buttons but are not actual `<button>` elements (e.g., `<a>` or `<div>` tags), unless they are part of a clear button component.

## 6. Design Considerations

*   The implementation must adhere strictly to the color tokens, and interaction patterns defined in `Design_System.md`.
*   Focus states (`focus-visible`) should also be considered to ensure accessibility, using the `2px outline brand/500 offset 2px` rule from the design system.

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   A preliminary codebase search has identified that buttons in the following files require review and potential updates. The developer assigned to this task will need to analyze each button to determine its variant (Primary, Secondary, Ghost, etc.) and apply the correct classes.
    *   `src/app/page.tsx`
    *   `src/app/components/AuthForm.tsx`
    *   `src/app/components/ConflictResolver.tsx`
    *   `src/app/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
    *   `src/app/components/OfflineStatusIndicator.tsx`
    *   `src/app/components/SyncProgress.tsx`
    *   `src/app/components/SyncStatusIndicator.tsx`
    *   `src/app/components/Toast.tsx`
*   The developer should leverage Tailwind's `theme.extend` capability in `tailwind.config.js` to define the design system's colors (e.g., `brand-500`, `bg-800`) if they aren't already, to make the class names more semantic and maintainable.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   A full visual audit of the application confirms that 100% of buttons provide visual feedback for both hover and active states.
*   The implemented styles are consistent and match the specifications in the `Design_System.md`.
*   Code review confirms that only button-related styles were changed and that the changes were implemented cleanly using Tailwind CSS.

## 9. Open Questions

*   Should we create abstract button components (e.g., `<PrimaryButton>`, `<SecondaryButton>`) to enforce consistency, or should we apply Tailwind classes directly to each `<button>` element? For now, direct application is acceptable, but component abstraction could be a future improvement.
