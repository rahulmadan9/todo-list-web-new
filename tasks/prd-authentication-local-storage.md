# PRD: Authentication & Local Storage Integration

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This feature transforms the to-do list app from a mandatory authentication system to an optional authentication model with seamless local storage support. Users can now access full to-do list functionality without logging in, with their tasks persisted locally across browser sessions. Authentication becomes an enhancement that enables cross-device synchronization by merging local tasks with cloud storage.

**Problem Statement**: Currently, users must authenticate to use the app, creating a barrier to entry. Users lose their tasks if they don't sign in, and there's no offline capability.

**Goal**: Enable frictionless task management with optional authentication for cross-device sync.

## 2. Goals

1. **Zero-Friction Entry**: Users can immediately start using the app without any authentication barriers
2. **Persistent Local Storage**: All tasks (authenticated and non-authenticated) are stored locally and persist across browser sessions
3. **Seamless Authentication**: Sign-in becomes an optional enhancement that merges local and cloud tasks
4. **Offline-First Experience**: App works fully offline for all users
5. **Cross-Device Sync**: Authenticated users can access their tasks across multiple devices
6. **Data Integrity**: Local and cloud tasks merge without data loss or conflicts

## 3. User Stories

| ID | As a... | I want to... | So that... |
|----|---------|---------------|-------------|
| US-1 | new user | immediately start creating tasks without signing up | I can try the app instantly without friction |
| US-2 | returning user | see my previous tasks when I reopen the browser | I don't lose my work between sessions |
| US-3 | user with local tasks | sign in to sync my tasks across devices | I can access my tasks on my phone and computer |
| US-4 | authenticated user | continue using the app when offline | I can work without internet connection |
| US-5 | user with both local and cloud tasks | have my local tasks merged with cloud tasks when signing in | I don't lose any of my work |
| US-6 | user | easily navigate between the main app and authentication | I can sign in or continue using the app as needed |

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Local Storage Implementation
1. The system must store all tasks in browser localStorage for both authenticated and non-authenticated users
2. The system must persist tasks across browser sessions and page refreshes
3. The system must use the same Task data structure for local storage as Firebase tasks
4. The system must handle localStorage quota limits gracefully with user notifications
5. The system must provide fallback mechanisms if localStorage is unavailable

### 4.2 Authentication Flow Changes
6. The system must allow users to access the main to-do list without authentication
7. The system must replace the "Sign Out" button with "Sign In" when user is not authenticated
8. The system must add a "Back to Tasks" button in the top-left corner of the authentication form
9. The system must maintain the existing authentication form functionality for sign-in/sign-up

### 4.3 Data Synchronization
10. The system must merge local tasks with cloud tasks when a user signs in
11. The system must append local tasks to cloud tasks during the merge process
12. The system must handle duplicate task detection and resolution during merge
13. The system must provide visual feedback during the sync process
14. The system must maintain task order and grouping after synchronization

### 4.4 Offline Support
15. The system must work fully offline for all users (authenticated and non-authenticated)
16. The system must queue offline actions for authenticated users when network is restored
17. The system must provide offline status indicators to users
18. The system must handle network reconnection gracefully

### 4.5 UI/UX Requirements
19. The system must maintain the existing design system and component styling
20. The system must provide clear visual distinction between local and synced tasks
21. The system must show sync status indicators for authenticated users
22. The system must provide smooth transitions between authentication states

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Real-time collaboration features
- Task sharing between users
- Advanced conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Biometric authentication
- Social login providers beyond email/password
- Task export/import functionality
- Advanced offline conflict resolution

## 6. Design Considerations

### 6.1 UI Changes
- **Sign In Button**: Replace "Sign Out" button in top-right corner with "Sign In" when user is not authenticated
- **Back to Tasks Button**: Add button in top-left corner of AuthForm component
- **Sync Indicators**: Add subtle indicators for sync status (optional enhancement)
- **Offline Indicator**: Add small offline indicator when network is unavailable

### 6.2 Data Flow
- **Local Storage**: All tasks stored in localStorage with same structure as Firebase
- **Merge Strategy**: Append local tasks to cloud tasks during sign-in
- **Conflict Resolution**: Use timestamp-based conflict resolution for duplicates

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Local Storage Implementation
- Use `localStorage` API with JSON serialization
- Implement error handling for quota limits
- Add data validation for stored tasks
- Consider IndexedDB for larger datasets (future enhancement)

### 7.2 Authentication State Management
- Modify existing Firebase auth state handling
- Add local storage state management
- Implement merge logic for local/cloud data

### 7.3 Offline Support
- Implement service worker for offline caching
- Add network status detection
- Queue offline actions for authenticated users

## 8. Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate**: Increase in users who create tasks (no authentication barrier)
- **Retention Rate**: Users returning to the app across sessions
- **Sync Success Rate**: Percentage of successful local-to-cloud merges
- **Offline Usage**: Time spent using app in offline mode
- **Error Rate**: Reduction in authentication-related errors

## 9. Open Questions

1. Should we implement a "guest mode" indicator to distinguish local-only users?
2. How should we handle very large task lists that might exceed localStorage limits?
3. Should we implement automatic backup/export functionality for local tasks?
4. How should we handle browser privacy settings that block localStorage?
5. Should we add a "sync now" button for authenticated users to manually trigger sync?

## 10. Implementation Notes

### 10.1 File Modifications Required
- `src/app/page.tsx`: Main logic changes for authentication flow and local storage
- `src/app/components/AuthForm.tsx`: Add "Back to Tasks" button
- `src/app/lib/firestore.ts`: Add local storage utilities and merge logic
- New utility files for localStorage management

### 10.2 Key Implementation Challenges
- Ensuring data consistency between local and cloud storage
- Handling network failures gracefully
- Managing localStorage quota limits
- Providing smooth user experience during sync operations

### 10.3 Testing Considerations
- Test localStorage quota limits
- Test offline functionality
- Test merge logic with various data scenarios
- Test authentication state transitions
- Test cross-browser compatibility
